"""The categorized symptom catalog + a fuzzy symptom matcher.

This module owns two pure, dependency-light concerns:

* **The catalog (Requirements 2 & 3).** A curated map of the nine required body-
  system categories to their selectable symptoms, plus a small synonym table so
  everyday phrasings ("short of breath", "tummy ache") resolve to a canonical
  symptom. Canonical names are aligned with the disease-prediction model's
  vocabulary wherever possible so the two subsystems agree.
* **Matching.** :class:`SymptomMatcher` resolves free-text or picked symptoms to
  canonical catalog entries (exact → synonym → fuzzy via RapidFuzz), reports the
  category of each, and powers autocomplete.

No I/O, no async, no framework types — trivially unit-testable.
